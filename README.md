An app created for family dinner discussions. You can draw photos and AI will generate discussion questions (preferably family photos to reminisce over). I have NOT included my photos in here because it would be a breach of privacy and security. 
To use the app upload you own photos in assets
name each photo "imageN" with n being the number you've assigned to your photo 
Also change the length variable accordingly to however many photos you've uploaded in assets 
You should be set from there
